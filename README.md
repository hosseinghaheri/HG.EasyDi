Define your services and interfaces:

    void DoSomething();
}

[EasyDi(ServiceLifetime.Singleton)]
public class SampleService : ISampleService
{
    public void DoSomething()
    {

    }
}
```

Register services in your Program.cs file:

Full Scan:
```C#
builder.Services.AddEasyDi();
```
Scan special namespace:
```C#
builder.Services.AddEasyDi(o=>o.SetNamespaceRootToScan("HG.EasyDi.PlantTest.Service"));
```
Inject and use the services in your controllers or other classes:
```C#
public class SampleController : ControllerBase
{
    private readonly ISampleService _sampleService;

    public SampleController(ISampleService sampleService)
    {
        _sampleService = sampleService;
    }

    // Controller actions
}
```
